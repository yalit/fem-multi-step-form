## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

My process in this project was to build the form step by step, starting with the first step and then adding the next steps especially when it comes to the state management. 

I did not start with the full state but built it piece by piece to make sure everything was working as expected. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- React and Typescript
- Full Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type checking
- [Zustand](https://zustand.surge.sh/) - For state management
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project was for me the challenge to build it the most quickly possible.

Confirmed the usage of Zustand as a state management library, it's really easy to use and to understand.

Managed to only use Tailwind CSS for the styling, it's really powerful and I'm getting more and more comfortable with it.
